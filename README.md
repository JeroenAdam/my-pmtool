I'm developing a chat-based collaboration workspace integrated with my own project management app.  
This repository is the part of the backend storing the projects, tasks, and user/bot tokens.

This REST API will be used by:
- Node.js middleware between Slack and this API, so that team members can handle their tasks/tickets right from Slack 
- React frontend with drag and drop experience (work in progress)
